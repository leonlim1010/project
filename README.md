In this javascript code, I used a for loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 100. For each number, it checks if it is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Based on the result, it adds the corresponding string to the output array, or if the number is neither divisible by 3 nor divisible by 5, it adds it as a string representation. Finally, the output array is written to a file named output.json using the fs module.
